# About Ijewuru

I saw the design online and it was originally designed for a mobile app. But thought to play around with it on the web using React Js and Typescript.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### Design Link

[figma](https://www.figma.com/file/KawxNnCZ1epHjQu0wSqlG2/Food-delivery-app-Ui-kit?node-id=298%3A40&mode=dev)

### `npm start`

The server starts on port:3000

### `npm test`

No test yet :)

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
